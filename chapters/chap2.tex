\section{Introduction}

The discussion thus far has focused on the performance of domain decomposition
from the perspective of particle communication and load imbalance penalties.
With an implementation that has minimized overhead as a result of these, we
should now have the ability to treat the full-core PWR problem with the desired
tally and material memory burdens. For this to be done efficiently, data
management algorithms should be designed with the full scale of the problem in
mind, such as the ones discussed. In
addition, careful attention must be paid to several practicalities related to
problem-specification and post-processing.

The size of the \ac{PWR} depletion problem was described.
