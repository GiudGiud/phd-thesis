\subsection{Deterministic Methods}
\label{subsec:chap1-deterministic}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 2D/1D methods in MPACT, nTracer
  \item Denovo, PDT, 3D OpenMOC, etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi-Group Cross Sections}
\label{sec:chap1-mgxs}

\begin{itemize}
  \item black magic ``crux'' of deterministic methods
  \item need accurate \ac{MGXS} for whole core transport methods
  \item motivate \ac{MC} for \ac{MGXS}
\end{itemize}
