\section{MGXS Clustering}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item show that clustering exists in MGXS
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item leave ``features'' and ML discussion for next chapter
  \end{itemize}
  \item histogram / rug plots of clustered MGXS
  \item quantile-quantile plots  
\end{itemize}

\section{Pin-Wise Population Variance}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item table of population variance of distribcell MGXS
  \item plots of convergence of pop. var. of distribell MGXS
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item MGXS in moderator and fuel
    \item pop. var. in fuel converges to non-zero value
    \item pop. var. in moderator is negligible
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Clustering MGXS with Local Neighbor Symmetry}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item objective is to capture clustering effects in MGXS
  \item introduce LNS algorithm, or reference from section on OpenCG
  \item present results -- keff, pin powers, etc. -- with LNS
  \item LNS isn't adaptable -- segue to next chapter
\end{itemize}
