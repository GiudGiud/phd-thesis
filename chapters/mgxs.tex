\section{Background}
\label{sec:chap2-background}

-discuss each approximation in sequence, building approximations upon one another similar to \ac{MOC} derivation in M.S. thesis?? \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item continuous energy neutron transport equation
  \item \ac{MGXS} equations
  \begin{itemize}
    \item generic reaction
    \item scattering matrix
    \item chi fission spectrum
  \end{itemize}
  \item equation and figures mapped to variables
  \item figure of continuous energy and \ac{MGXS}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item U-235 nu-fission
    \item U-238 capture
    \item 2-, 8-, 70-groups
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
