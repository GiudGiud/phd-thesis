Monte Carlo (MC) neutral particle transport methods have long been considered
the gold-standard for nuclear simulations, but high computational cost has
limited their use significantly. However, as we move towards higher-fidelity
nuclear reactor analyses the method has become competitive with traditional
deterministic transport algorithms for the same level of accuracy, especially
considering the inherent parallelism of the method and the ever-increasing
concurrency of modern high performance computers. Yet before such analysis can
be practical, several algorithmic challenges must be addressed, particularly in
regards to the memory requirements of the method. In this thesis, a robust
domain decomposition algorithm is proposed to alleviate this, along with models
and analysis to support its use for full-scale reactor analysis. Algorithms were
implemented in the full-physics Monte Carlo code OpenMC, and tested for a
highly-detailed PWR benchmark: BEAVRS.
