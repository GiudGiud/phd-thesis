\chapter{MGXS Generation with Monte Carlo}
\label{chap:mgxs-mc}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \ac{MC} is \emph{reactor agnostic}
  \item stochastic approx. to integrals in Section~\ref{sec:chap2-background}
  \item tally ``noise'' model
  \item uncertainty propagation equations
  \item mention recent work to use MC for MGXS (chap. 3 of nelson's thesis)
\end{itemize}
