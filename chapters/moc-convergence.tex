\chapter{Convergence of MOC Source Iteration}
\label{chap:moc-convergence}

In the previous chapters, the implementation of methods in OpenMOC has been discussed in great detail. All of these methods rely on the \ac{MOC} form of the transport equation, presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:moc}. More specifically, these methods rely on source iteration to converge the solution. The \ac{MOC} equations are addressed from a general linear algebra perspective illuminating the deficiencies of source iteration, whose stability is addressed. While convergence is straightforward for physical cross-sections, transport correction can cause convergence issues. A stabilization technique is proposed, termed diagonal stabilization, which can alleviate the convergence issues.

\section{Source Iteration Stability}
\label{sec:source-iteration}

The \ac{MOC} system of equations leads to a linear system of the form
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\phi} = J \left(\frac{1}{k} F + S \right) \boldsymbol{\phi}.
	\label{eq:transport-simplified}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is a vector representing all scalar fluxes and $J$, $F$, and $S$ are matrices. Matrix-vector multiplications with $J$ are termed transport sweeps in which the \ac{MOC} equations are applied over segments. A more complete description of the \ac{MOC} linear system is found in Appendix~\ref{app:matrix-moc} in which the structure of matrices $J$, $F$, and $S$ are explicitly identified. The form in Eq~\ref{eq:transport-simplified} is not unique to \ac{MOC}, but rather many methods solve the multi-group transport equation in the same form, differing only in the way matrix-vector products with $J$ are computed.

For physical cross-sections, the matrices $J$, $F$, and $S$ are all positive. However, when transport correction is introduced, discussed further in Appendix~\ref{app:transport-correction}, components of the scattering matrix can become negative. Specifically, for a region $i$ and energy group $g$, the transport correction $\Delta \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g}$ is applied to both the total cross-section $\Sigma_{t}^{i, g}$ and within-group scattering cross-section $\Sigma_{s}^{i, g \rightarrow g}$ resulting in a transport cross-section $\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g}$ and transport-corrected within-group scattering cross-section $\tilde{\Sigma}_{s, i}^{g \rightarrow g}$ as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i,g} = \Sigma_{t}^{i,g} -  \Delta \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g} \\
\tilde{\Sigma}_{s}^{i,g \rightarrow g} = \Sigma_{s}^{i, g \rightarrow g} -  \Delta \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g}
\end{split}
\label{eq:total-xs}
\end{equation}

When using large numbers of energy groups, the within-group scattering cross-sections can become small, and the modified within-group scattering cross-section can become negative with transport correction. Tabuchi discovered negative within-group scattering cross-sections to be an issue when converging within-group scattering iterations of \ac{MOC}~\cite{ty-problem}. The study used an iteration scheme in which the spatial distribution is converged for each estimate of the neutron source. The iterations to converge the spatial distribution are termed \textit{inner iterations}. It was identified that the iteration matrix for inner iterations could have a spectral radius greater than unity, causing the system not to converge. Tabuchi later proposed a stabilization technique for inner iterations~\cite{ty-solution}.

In this section, the ideas presented by Tabuchi are expanded to explain the observed convergence behavior of source iteration without inner iterations. Convergence is analyzed with transport-corrected cross-sections. Realistic full core cases are presented that fail to converge and a new stabilizing method is proposed to stabilize source iteration.

\subsection{MOC Equivalence with Collision Probability Methods}
\label{sec:equiv-cpm}

Deterministic methods such as flat source \ac{MOC} are equivalent to the collision probability form, aside from discretization errors~\cite{ty-problem}. Although collision probabilities do not explicitly enter the \ac{MOC} equations, the neutron balance equation takes the form in Eq.~\ref{eq:cpm-form}:
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g} \phi_{i,g} V_i = \sum_j P_{ji, g} q_{j,g} V_j
	\label{eq:cpm-form}
\end{equation}
where $P_{ji,g}$ represents the collision probability of a neutron of energy group $g$ from region $j$ to region $i$, $V_i$ represents the volume of region $i$, $q_{i,g}$ represents the neutron source and $\phi_{i,g}$ represents the average scalar flux in region $i$ and group $g$. In general, the neutron source can be computed by summing contributions from all $G$ energy groups as
\begin{equation}
	q_{i,g} = \sum_{g'=1}^G \left( \Sigma_{s}^{i,g'\rightarrow g} \phi_{i,g'} + \chi_{i,g} \nu \Sigma_{f}^{i,g'} \phi_{i,g'} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma_{s}^{i, g'\rightarrow g}$ is the scattering cross-section in region $i$ from group $g'$ to group $g$, $\chi_{i,g}$ is the fission emission probability for group $g$ in region $i$, and $\nu \Sigma_{f}^{i,g'}$ is the fission production in region $i$ from group $g'$. Combining this definition with Eq.~\ref{eq:cpm-form}, as well as the reciprocity relationship, 
\begin{equation}
	P_{ij, g} \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g} V_i = P_{ji, g} \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g} V_j,
	\label{eq:reciprocity}
\end{equation}
neutron balance can be presented in the form of Eq.~\ref{eq:cpm-balance}.
\begin{equation}
	\phi_{i,g} = \sum_j \frac{P_{ij, g} \sum_{g'=1}^G \left( \Sigma_{s}^{j, g'\rightarrow g} \phi_{j,g'} + \chi_{j,g} \nu \Sigma_{f}^{j,g'} \phi_{j,g'} \right)}{\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g}} 
	\label{eq:cpm-balance}
\end{equation}
Notice that this is in the form of Eq.~\ref{eq:transport-simplified}. Therefore, the matrix $A = J\left(\frac{1}{k}F + S\right)$, with rows and columns indexed by $(i, g)$  where $i$ is the region and $g$ is the energy group, can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	A_{(i,g), (j, g')} = P_{ij}^g \left(\frac{\chi_{j,g} \nu\Sigma_{f}^{j,g'} / k + \Sigma_{s}^{j,g' \rightarrow g}}{\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g}}\right).
	\label{eq:a-matrix}
\end{equation}
Matrix $A$ is square and dense with length equal to the number of scalar fluxes. 

\subsection{Iteration Schemes}
\label{sec:moc-iteration-schemes}

\subsubsection{Power Method}

The power method is one common method to solve an eigenvalue problem, such as the form given in Eq.~\ref{eq:transport-simplified}, which yields the dominant eigenvector corresponding to the steady-state flux distribution. To invoke the power method, Eq.~\ref{eq:transport-simplified} can be re-arranged to the form in Eq.~\ref{eq:eigenvalue} where $I$ represents the identity matrix.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Z \equiv \left(I-JS\right)^{-1} JF \\
Z \boldsymbol{\phi} =  k \boldsymbol{\phi}
\end{split}
\label{eq:eigenvalue}
\end{equation}
With the power method scheme, repeated multiplication by $Z$ yields the dominant eigenvector~\cite{numerical-analysis}. Rather than performing strict power method iterations, the estimate of the eigenvalue $k_n$ at iteration $n$ is often included in the source. This scheme is presented in Eq.~\ref{eq:power-method}. These iterations are often termed \textit{outer iterations}.
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1} =  \left(I-JS\right)^{-1} J\frac{F}{k_n} \boldsymbol{\phi}_n
\label{eq:power-method}
\end{equation}
Since explicitly taking the matrix inverse of $I-JS$ is unwise, an iterative scheme is necessary to solve the linear system. In many transport methods, such as \ac{MOC}, computing each element of $J$ can be just as expensive as computing a matrix-vector product. In addition, each matrix-vector product with matrix $J$ is usually quite expensive (often termed \textit{transport sweeps}). Therefore, few methods are available to efficiently solve the linear system in practice. 

\subsubsection{Source Iteration}

An alternative way to solve the transport equation is to directly apply the transport sweep to the full neutron source. Note that the neutron source $\mathbf{q}$ can be computed as 
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{q} = \left(\frac{1}{k} F + S \right) \boldsymbol{\phi}. 
\end{equation*}
The transport sweep matrix $J$ therefore yields the scalar flux distribution associated with the computed source distribution. In this form, a new iterative process could be introduced in which a new source distribution is computed at each iteration, yielding a new estimate of the associated scalar flux distribution. Therefore, solving the transport equation in this form where source terms are lagged is termed \textit{source iteration}.  Specifically, the eigenvalue problem in Eq.~\ref{eq:transport-simplified} is iteratively solved with the left hand side updated and the right hand side lagged as
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1} =  J\left(\frac{F\boldsymbol{\phi}_n}{k_n} + S\boldsymbol{\phi}_n\right).
	\label{eq:power-method-full-source}
\end{equation}
It is important to note that this process is non-linear due to the iteration matrix $J\left(\frac{1}{k_n} F + S\right)$ being dependent on the iteration number $n$. To simplify this relationship, assume that the eigenvalue $k$ is perfectly known to be $k_{\textit{crit}}$, the eigenvalue associated with the dominant mode of the system. In reality, the exact value of $k_{\textit{crit}}$ is not known a priori but observations and intuition suggests that it does not strongly impact convergence. With the eigenvalue fixed, the system becomes 
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1} =  A \boldsymbol{\phi}_n
\end{equation}
where matrix $A$ is defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:a-matrix} with $k = k_{\textit{crit}}$. This process is equivalent to power method iterations with the matrix $A$, which converges to the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue of $A$. Since $k_{\textit{crit}}$ is the dominant eigenvalue of the original system, 1.0 must be an eigenvalue of $A$. In addition, if an everywhere positive solution exists, it must be associated with the physical solution.

Recall from Eq.~\ref{eq:a-matrix} that the iteration matrix $A$ is everywhere positive and real as long as the within-group scattering cross-section is positive. According to the Perron-Frobenius Theorem~\cite{perron-frobenius}, square matrices of all positive real entries have a unique largest real eigenvalue which is dominant and associated with an everywhere positive eigenvector. In addition, all other eigenvectors must have a negative component. Without transport correction, the iteration matrix $A$ is an all positive and real matrix, implying that the largest eigenvalue is 1.0 and is associated with the physical solution. Therefore, the process detailed in Eq.~\ref{eq:power-method-full-source} will converge to the physical solution.

However, with the transport correction, it is possible to have negative within-group scattering, causing this condition not to hold. Therefore, the system might still converge, but convergence cannot be guaranteed under the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. Therefore, the iteration scheme should be updated to ensure convergence. 

\subsection{Stabilization of Source Iteration}
\label{sec:diagonal-stabilization}

Note that Eq.~\ref{eq:damped-transport} is a mathematically valid rewriting of Eq.~\ref{eq:transport-simplified} for \textit{any matrix} $D$ where $I+D$ is invertible. 
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\phi} = (I+D)^{-1} \left[J \left(\frac{1}{k} F + S \right) + D \right]\boldsymbol{\phi}
	\label{eq:damped-transport}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%	\boldsymbol{\phi}_{n+1} = (I+D)^{-1} \left[J \left(\frac{1}{k_n} F + S \right) + D \right]\boldsymbol{\phi}_n
%\end{equation}
Next, the same source iteration scheme is applied where the left hand side is updated with the right hand side constant. Since $I+D$ needs to be easily invertible for this new scheme to be efficient, $D$ is chosen to be diagonal. The convergence discussion then follows the same discussion as before except the new iteration matrix  now has the form $\tilde{A} = (I+D)^{-1} \left[ J \left(\frac{1}{k_{\textit{crit}}} F + S \right) + D \right]$  with the matrix $\tilde{A}$ is described by
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{A}_{(i,g), (j, g')} = \frac{1}{1 + D_{(i,g), (i,g)}}\left[P_{ij}^g \left(\frac{\chi_{j,g} \nu\Sigma_{f}^{j,g'} / k_{\textit{crit}} + \Sigma_{s}^{j,g' \rightarrow g}}{\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g}}\right) + D_{(i,g), (j, g')}\right]
	\label{eq:a-tilde}
\end{equation}
where the rows and columns are again indexed by region, energy group pairs. The diagonal elements of $D$ are chosen to be:
\begin{equation}
	D_{(i,g), (i,g)} = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
		\frac{-\rho \Sigma_{s}^{i,g \rightarrow g}}{\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{i, g}} , & \text{for } \Sigma_{s}^{i, g \rightarrow g} < 0\\
		0, & \text{otherwise}
	\end{array}\right.
	\label{eq:d-matrix}
\end{equation}
where the damping coefficient $\rho$ is a positive value chosen by the user. For $\rho = 1$, the diagonal update ensures that there are no negative diagonal elements in the iteration matrix. 

%If $A$ is symmetric, this approach can be proven to ensure convergence for $\rho=1$. A detailed proof is given in Appendix~\ref{app:convergence}. However, the matrix $A$ is rarely symmetric for common reactor physics problems. Still, this method could have utility even for non-symmetric $A$.

The diagonal stabilization scheme has the effect of shifting the iteration matrix eigenvalues to be more positive. The intuition for this shift is due to the Gershgorin Disk Theorem where eigenvalues exist in disks around diagonal elements. Since the diagonal elements are increased and all matrix elements are contracted, the Gershgorin Disks are likewise shifted positive with their radii contracted. While this improves stability, it also tightens the positive-eigenvalue modes, causing larger dominance ratios in the iteration matrix, and slower convergence. Therefore, $\rho$ should be chosen to be small while still ensuring convergence. An illustration of the shift in eigenvalues is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eig-shift}.

\end{figure}

Tabuchi suggested a similar scheme for converging inner within-group scattering iterations of \ac{MOC} transport sweeps~\cite{ty-solution}. Though originally limited to \ac{MOC} transport sweeps with inner within-group scattering iterations, Tabuchi's scheme is equivalent to the diagonal stabilization scheme presented here for damping the scalar flux update except for the choice of diagonal matrix $\tilde{D}$ in place of $D$ with elements
\begin{equation}
\tilde{D}_{(i,g), (i,g)} = \max_j \left|\frac{\Sigma_{s}^{j, g \rightarrow g}}{\Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g}} \right|
\end{equation}
which is far larger than the equivalent formulation given in Eq.~\ref{eq:d-matrix}. Not only is the damping applied to all fluxes, not just those with negative within-group scattering, but it also takes the maximum ratio of within-group scattering to transport cross-section $\Sigma_{s}^{j,g \rightarrow g} / \Sigma_{\textit{tr}}^{j, g}$ across all regions $j$, which may already be positive.

It is important to note that in the OpenMOC implementation, negative sources are set to zero in the first 20 iterations. In addition, negative fluxes are always set to zero. Whenever the correction is applied during an iteration, a warning message is displayed, alerting the user to the behavior. Negative sources and fluxes are an important indicator of convergence issues, as a solution corresponding with a negative eigenvalue will have negative components in its associated eigenvector. While setting negative sources and fluxes to zero helps the convergence behavior by more quickly eliminating non-physical behavior, it does not remedy the fundamental convergence issues introduced by negative cross-sections without the use of a stabilization technique such as diagonal stabilization.

\subsection{Convergence Criteria}
\label{sec:conv-criteria}

Since the \ac{MOC} equations are converged iteratively with source iteration, a convergence tolerance must be chosen for the simulation. In this thesis, convergence is determined by iterative change in the neutron production rate. Specifically, the neutron production rate $f_i$ in a source region $i$ can be computed with a sum of contributions from all $G$ energy groups as
\begin{equation}
f_i = \sum_{g=1}^G \nu \Sigma_f^{i,g} \overline{\phi_{i,g}}
\end{equation}
for the current estimate of scalar fluxes $\overline{\phi_{i,g}}$. The relative change in fission rate, termed \texttt{eps-MOC}, in iteration $n$ can be computed as
\begin{equation}
\texttt{esp-MOC} = \frac{1}{N_f} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in N_f} \left(\frac{f_i^n - f_i^{n-1}}{f_i^{n-1}}\right)^2}
\label{eq:eps-MOC}
\end{equation}
where $N_f$ is the number of regions with a nonzero neutron production rate and $f_i^n$ refers to the neutron production rate of region $i$ in iteration $n$. For all results in this thesis, convergence is determined when \texttt{esp-MOC} is reduced to $10^{-4}$ and the change in eigenvalue estimate from the previous iteration is less than 1 pcm. 

\subsection{Convergence of Source Iteration}
\label{sec:si-convergence}

In order to test the convergence behavior of the stabilization methods, the stabilization methods were implemented in OpenMOC. The single assembly test problem described in Appendix~\ref{app:beavrs-single-assembly} is used to test convergence behavior. Results in this section focus on the flat source 3D \ac{MOC} solver in OpenMOC for simplicity, using the \ac{MOC} parameters given in Table~\ref{tab:convergence-tests-params}. While finer \ac{MOC} parameters would be necessary to accurately resolve the solution, convergence has not been observed to change substantially from refining \ac{MOC} parameters.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption{MOC parameters for single assembly convergence studies}
	\medskip
	\begin{tabular}{lc}
		\hline
		Source Approximation & Flat \\
		Number of Sectors in Moderator & 8 \\
		Number of Sectors in Fuel & 4 \\
		Height of Flat Source Regions & 2.0 cm \\
		Radial Ray Spacing & 0.1 cm \\
		Axial Ray Spacing & 1.5 cm \\
		Number of Azimuthal Angles & 32 \\
		Number of Polar Angles & 6 \\
		Domain Decomposition & $1 \times 1 \times 100$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:convergence-tests-params}
\end{table}

To analyze the convergence behavior, an error metric is needed. Usually, error is analyzed in terms of \ac{RMS} error in the fission distribution over all fissile regions. During simulations, this can only be compared in terms of results from previous iterations. However, for these convergence studies, a reference solution is used which represents the final fission distribution of a tightly converged case. Therefore, error can reliably be assessed rather than the difference with previous iterations.

In order to focus on the asymptotic convergence behavior, rather than the behavior far from convergence, the \ac{MOC} simulations start with a \textit{good guess} of the scalar flux distribution. Specifically, the \ac{MOC} convergence criteria is chosen to be extremely tight and a converging simulation where the error drops below $3\times 10^{-5}$ on \ac{RMS} fission rate error is chosen as the starting point.

The convergence behavior is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:no-cmfd} in which the relative error is plotted as a function of iteration number for a variety of stabilizing schemes.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/convergence/no_cmfd.png}
	\caption{Convergence behavior of different stabilization schemes. TY Stabilization refers to the approach presented by Tabuchi whereas Diagonal Stabilization refers to the approach presented in this paper with damping coefficient $\rho$.}
	\label{fig:no-cmfd}
\end{figure}
Notice that the case without stabilization diverges while all the stabilization cases converge except for the new diagonal stabilization scheme with damping factor $\rho = 1/128$. This is expected since as $\rho$ approaches zero, the stabilization method becomes equivalent to source iteration without stabilization. This clearly shows that this problem requires stabilization to converge with source iteration. In addition, the more conservative the stabilization scheme, the more convergence is slowed. The scheme proposed by Tabuchi slows convergence the most. The diagonal damping scheme hinders convergence significantly less, especially for $\rho < 1$.

\subsection{Convergence Results with CMFD Acceleration}
\label{sec:cmfd-stab}

In Section~\ref{sec:source-iteration}, the convergence of source iteration and its stability properties were discussed. When \ac{CMFD} acceleration is applied, as detailed in Section~\ref{app:cmfd-acceleration}, the behavior is much more difficult to analyze since \ac{CMFD} is a non-linear process. Therefore, discussion of \ac{CMFD} results will focus on hypotheses to explain the observed results rather than rigorous analysis. 

In this section, the \ac{CMFD} mesh is always chosen to be uniform with cells of pin-cell pitch in the radial dimensions and 2.0 cm in the axial dimension. In addition, a relaxation factor of 0.7 is applied to the \ac{CMFD} acceleration scheme for computing corrected diffusion coefficients. Many \ac{CMFD} implementations choose to collapse to a fewer number of energy groups in order to improve the speed of the \ac{CMFD} solver. While the \ac{CMFD} equations are computationally less expensive in collapsed few-group structures, it is possible that collapsing group structures could cause slower convergence by not fully resolving spectral effects. Results with a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures are presented. While the \ac{MOC} calculation always uses a 70 group structure, \ac{CMFD} group structures are formed with $G_C$ \ac{CMFD} groups, with group ranges taken from the CASMO-4 Manual~\cite{edenius1995casmo}, as presented in Appendix~\ref{app:energy-groups}.

All of the stability results presented in this section use the parameters in Section~\ref{tab:convergence-tests-params} unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{Single Assembly Convergence with Water Reflectors}
\label{sec:sa-axial-ref}

The single assembly model previously analyzed for pure source iteration in Section~\ref{sec:si-convergence} is first analyzed with \ac{CMFD} acceleration using the same parameters. It is important to remember that this problem includes axial water reflectors. These large regions of water where the transport-correction is large could potentially have a strong impact on convergence. The results with \ac{CMFD} applied and \textit{without} any \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sa-cmfd-no-stab} for a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures with the error once again relative to a tightly converged reference.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/convergence/sa_no_stab_cmfd.png}
	\caption{Convergence behavior for a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures with $G_C$ \ac{CMFD} groups and \textit{without} \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization.}
	\label{fig:sa-cmfd-no-stab}
\end{figure}
As expected, most of the trials have trouble converging. This is likely due to the convergence issue observed with pure source iteration. However, the 70 group \ac{CMFD} scheme appears to be stable. It is important to remember that the \ac{CMFD} equations do not suffer from the issue of a negative dominant eigenvalue since the \ac{CMFD} equations can be written such that within-group scattering does not arise when removal cross-sections are used instead of total cross-sections.

If 70 group \ac{CMFD} is driving the convergence process, then the instability in the underlying source iteration technique appears to be overcome by the \ac{CMFD} acceleration prolongation in which \ac{MOC} scalar fluxes are updated with the \ac{CMFD} solution. One way of interpreting this behavior is to think of the convergence as being dominated by the \ac{CMFD} acceleration where \ac{MOC} transport sweeps are used purely to resolve local behavior, integrate reaction rates to form \ac{CMFD} cross-sections, and tally currents crossing \ac{CMFD} mesh surfaces. 

However, with a reduced \ac{CMFD} group structure, the flux distribution in energy within a single \ac{CMFD} group \textit{must} be resolved by the \ac{MOC} source iteration process. Since the underlying \ac{MOC} source iteration process is unstable, any reliance on the process for convergence using a reduced group structure appears to lead to instability.

\subsection{Single Assembly Convergence with Stabilization}

To verify that the convergence issue can be remedied with \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization, the same single assembly test is conducted but using diagonal stabilization with $\rho = 1/4$. For pure source iteration, this was sufficient for stabilization, as previously shown in Figure~\ref{fig:no-cmfd}. The results using this stabilization with \ac{CMFD} acceleration are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sa-cmfd-stab}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/convergence/sa_stab_cmfd.png}
	\caption{Convergence behavior for a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures with $G_C$ \ac{CMFD} groups and \textit{with} Diagonal \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization ($\rho = 1/4$).}
	\label{fig:sa-cmfd-stab}
\end{figure}
As expected, the \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization fixes the convergence issues for all \ac{CMFD} group structures, indicating that the convergence issue was caused by the underlying \ac{MOC} source iteration.

\subsection{Single Assembly without Axial Water Reflectors}
\label{sec:sa-no-axial-ref}

Next, the truncated single assembly model is studied, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:trunc-single-assembly}. This model is the same as the single assembly model but without the axial water reflectors, using a $1\times 1\times 90$ domain decomposition. Without reflectors, this model is more similar to lattice physics models. The convergence behavior is analyzed \textit{without} source iteration stabilization. The results with \ac{CMFD} acceleration for a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:truncated-convergence}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/convergence/sa_trunc_no_stab.png}
	\caption{Convergence behavior for the single assembly \textit{without} axial reflectors with a variety of \ac{CMFD} group structures with $G_C$ \ac{CMFD} groups and \textit{without} \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization.}
	\label{fig:truncated-convergence}
\end{figure}
Notice that the convergence issues are not present in this model. This indicates the issue is caused by the axial water reflectors. More generally, it appears to be a problem with deep water reflectors that have negative cross-sections. Recall from the theory discussion that iteration matrix components in Eq.~\ref{eq:a-matrix} were formed with the product of collision probability and self-scattering cross-sections. In deep water reflectors, the probability of transport between water regions containing negative cross-sections is significantly higher than in the active fuel where many neutrons collide with fuel. This motivates neutron behavior in deep reflectors causing the instability. 

\subsection{Full Core Behavior}

The previous results were focused on a single assembly with and without axial reflectors which proved the existence of source iteration instability. Since this issue seems to only appear at very low errors, the reader might judge this issue to be purely academic. However, for problems where deeper reflectors exist, such as a typical full core \ac{LWR} problem, this issue is exacerbated. To test this effect, full core models are simulated using the same cross-section set applied in the single assembly studies. The geometry outside the core is radially discretized into a $3 \times 3$ square grid within each pin-cell-sized region.

\subsubsection{2D Extruded Model}

Before simulating the explicit 3D model, the 2D extruded model detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:beavrs-2D} is studied. This model lacks the axial water reflectors but still contains significant water reflectors in the radial direction. A $17 \times 17 \times 1$ domain decomposition is used. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fc-2D}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{figures/convergence/fc_2D.png}
	\caption{Convergence behavior of \ac{CMFD} group structures with $G_C$ \ac{CMFD} groups and Diagonal \ac{MOC} source iteration stabilization with stabilization coefficient $\rho$.}
	\label{fig:fc-2D}
\end{figure}
The simulation is run with 8 group and 70 group \ac{CMFD} with Diagonal Stabilization. The damping coefficient $\rho$ is chosen for both cases to be zero (equivalent to no stabilization) and $1/4$. For all reduced \ac{CMFD} group structures, similar results are observed as seen with the 8 group \ac{CMFD} structure in Figure~\ref{fig:fc-2D} in which reasonable convergence can only be obtained by applying the \ac{MOC} diagonal stabilization.

\subsubsection{Explicit 3D Model}

Now the full core 3D BEAVRS model is simulated, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:beavrs-3D}. Since the problem is large, the \ac{MOC} angular quadrature is significantly coarsened to 4 azimuthal angles and 2 polar angles in order to run a significant number of iterations on the Cetus partition of the Argonne BlueGene/Q supercomputer. These parameters are very coarse, but still exhibit the convergence issue. Since the run time with coarse angles can become dominated by the \ac{CMFD} solution time, it is infeasible to use 70 \ac{CMFD} groups on the Cetus partition. Therefore, results are presented only for a reduced 8 group \ac{CMFD} structure. A $17 \times 17 \times 5$ domain decomposition is used. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fc-3D} both with and without using the Diagonal Stabilization technique with $\rho = 1/4$.

These results show that for the 3D full core \ac{PWR} problem, a stabilization technique is necessary in order to reach any reasonable convergence, especially when it is computationally infeasible to use a many-group \ac{CMFD} solver.

\subsubsection{Explicit 3D Model with Linear Source}

The preceding tests have all been conducted using a flat source approximation. However, the goal of this thesis is to solve full core \ac{LWR} problems with a linear source approximation. While the theory of the diagonal stabilization was developed for flat source, it can also be applied to simulations with a linear source approximation. In the OpenMOC implementation, the same damping of each flat source flux is applied to the associated linear source moments. Again, a $17 \times 17 \times 5$ domain decomposition is used. The results using a linear source approximation are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:fc-3D-ls} for the full core 3D BEAVRS benchmark, showing similar results to those with a flat source approximation.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:convergence-conclusion}

In this chapter, a theoretical analysis of source iteration convergence was presented which showed the possibility for source iteration instabilities with transport-corrected cross-sections. The theory was broadened to include source iterations without inner within-group scattering iterations. A new diagonal stabilization technique was presented which is substantially less conservative than previously proposed techniques. Realistic reactor physics problems were presented that showed instability with the source iteration process. The diagonal stabilization technique was shown to successfully stabilize the source iteration process without having much impact on convergence rate.

Results were also presented for convergence with \ac{CMFD} acceleration which showed that \ac{CMFD} acceleration without group collapse was able to stabilize the source iteration process. For \ac{CMFD} acceleration with a collapsed group structure, the previously discussed stabilization techniques were necessary to ensure convergence. In the case of full core \ac{PWR} problems, a collapsed group structure is often attractive to reduce run time, necessitating a stabilization method in order to converge.
