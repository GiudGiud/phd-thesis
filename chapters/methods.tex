\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:chap6-motivate}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item identify metrics of interest - eigenvalue, fission, capture rates
  \item motivate with results for degenerate, null, LNS cases
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item table of eigenvalues
    \item histogram of fission/capture max/mean errors
    \item 
  \end{itemize}

\section{Approaches to Clustering}
\label{sec:chap6-cluster}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item dataset restrictions
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item ``pinch'' clustering a \textit{single} nuclide/group/reaction triplet
    \item ``combined'' clustering one or more nuclide/group pairs \textit{together}
    \item ``local'' clustering one or more nuclide/group pairs \textit{separately}
  \end{itemize}
  \item clustering algorithms
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item discriminative clustering ($k$-means++, agglomerative, etc.)
    \item generative clustering (gaussian mixtures, dirichlet processes)
  \end{itemize}
  \item ``regression-informed'' clustering
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item use a regressor to predict ``smoothed'' of target variable(s)
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
      \item decision tree regression
      \item ensemble (boosting, random forest) regression
      \item Gaussian Process regression
    \end{itemize}
    \item cluster predictions produced by regressor
    \item advantage is that objective function \textit{may} be more appropriate
  \end{itemize}
