\chapter{MGXS Generation with Monte Carlo}
\label{chap:mgxs-mc}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item mitigate all of the pain and effort of coming up with approximations!!!
  \item \ac{MC} is \emph{reactor agnostic}
  \item spatial self-shielding is natural
  \item look at prospectus for paragraph
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview of Monte Carlo Methods}
\label{sec:chap3-mc-overview}

Everything can be found in the MCNP, Serpent and OpenMC manuals. This section follows the OpenMC manual.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item general form eqn (Eqn. (1))
  \item scores/score function, filters
  \item analog vs. collision vs. tracklength tallies (Eqns. (2), (4), (9))
  \item use tilde above transport / scatter xs, and hat above estimates
\end{itemize}
