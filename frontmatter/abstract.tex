A key challenge for whole-core deterministic neutron transport methods is accurate reactor agnostic multi-group cross section (MGXS) generation. No systematic methodology of approximations has been developed which is broadly applicable to all reactor types. Monte Carlo (MC) presents the most accurate method for reactor agnostic multi-group cross section generation since it does not require the use of any local approximations to the flux. This improvement in accuracy comes at the computational expense of converging group constant tallies to acceptably low uncertainties. MC methods have increasingly been used to generate few group constants for coarse mesh diffusion, most notably by the Serpent MC code. This work investigates the use of MC methods to generate MGXS for high-fidelity whole-core transport codes.

%The nuclear reactor physics community has long strived for deterministic neutron transport-based tools for full-core reactor analysis. 

This thesis is organized along two main themes. First, the efficacy of MGXS generation with MC for fine mesh transport calculations is rigorously assessed. Some of the approximations made by MC-based MGXS generation are quantified, including the angular, energy- and spatial-dependence of condensed MGXS. The second theme develops a novel methodology called inferential MGXS (\textit{i}MGXS) which directly models all energy and spatial self-shielding effects to generate accurate MGXS with a single whole-core MC calculation. The \textit{i}MGXS scheme is a data processing pipeline that uses unsupervised machine learning algorithms to infer the clustering of MGXS from ``noisy'' MC tally data with limited human supervision.

The \textit{i}MGXS scheme is evaluated for six PWR benchmarks with heterogeneities which induce spatial self-shielding effects, including control rod guide tubes and water reflectors. The \textit{i}MGXS scheme was shown to enable highly accurate predictions of U-238 capture rate predictions, reducing the error by 3 -- 4$\times$ with respect to schemes which neglect to model MGXS clustering. In addition, the scheme requires at least 10$\times$ fewer MC particle histories to converge MGXS for accurate multi-group deterministic calculations than a reference MC calculation. These results demonstrate the promise for \textit{i}MGXS as a means to efficiently generate MGXS with reactor agnostic MC calculations of the complete heterogeneous geometry in a single step.

%Nevertheless, it points to the potential for \textit{i}MGXS to harness \ac{MC} to efficiently generate accurate \ac{MGXS} for deterministic transport codes.

%The inference of MGXS clustering with the \textit{i}MGXS scheme enables deterministic reactor physics simulations to produce accurate results from MGXS generated by MC faster than would be possible with a direct calculation with MC.
