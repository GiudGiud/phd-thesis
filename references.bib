  abstract = "The cross sections of many important nuclides are represented in Reichâ€“Moore (RM) formalism in the recent American Evaluated Nuclear Data file, ENDF/B-VI. Processing of cross sections with \{RM\} resonance parameters is much more difficult than the other multilevel formalisms such as \{MLBW\} and Adlerâ€“Adler. In this paper, we derive a rational approximation to the \{RM\} collision matrix in the vicinity of a resonance. This simplifies the cross section processing. The energy range of the validity of this approximation in the vicinity of a resonance is also derived. Choosing Ni58 as an example, results of our approximation for a non-fissile nuclide are given for two typical s-wave resonances. Our rational approximation method is found to work with good accuracies in the vicinity of resonances. "
