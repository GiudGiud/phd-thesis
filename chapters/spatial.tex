\section{MGXS Clustering}

first paragraph:
-

second paragraph:
-

-want to look at all five benchmarks in succession with different MGXS clusters
  -plots of U-238 capture (group 27/1); U-235 fission (group 65/2)
    -octo plots
    -histrogram/rug/kde
    -QQ plots
-need to plot for both assemblies in colorsets
-need to plot for all three enrichments for BEAVRS
  
-look at slides 66-71 in ORNL presentation

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item show that clustering exists in MGXS
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item leave ``features'' and ML discussion for next chapter
  \end{itemize}
  \item histogram / rug plots of clustered MGXS
  \item quantile-quantile plots  
\end{itemize}

\section{Pin-Wise Population Variance}

-plot the convergence of null MGXS by batch along with max for distribcell MGXS
-plot the pop. var. convergence of the distribcell MGXS and show that they don't go to zero
-plot the convergence of the distribcell MGXS for 1.6\% enr. assm, 3.1\% assm w/ BPs, 2x2 colorset w/ reflector???

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item table of population variance of distribcell MGXS
  \item plots of convergence of pop. var. of distribell MGXS
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item MGXS in moderator and fuel
    \item pop. var. in fuel converges to non-zero value
    \item pop. var. in moderator is negligible
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Clustering MGXS with Local Neighbor Symmetry}

-need to define \ac{LNS} spatial homogenization
-refer back to workflow chapter and OpenCG

-boxplots / violin plots of MGXS for each???
-keff with LNS
-fission error w/ LNS
-U-238 error w/ LNS
-improved errors wrt. null homogenization

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item objective is to capture clustering effects in MGXS
  \item introduce LNS algorithm, or reference from section on OpenCG
  \item present results -- keff, pin powers, etc. -- with LNS
  \item LNS isn't adaptable -- segue to next chapter
\end{itemize}
