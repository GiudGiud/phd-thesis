\chapter{The BEAVRS Benchmark}
\label{chap:beavrs}

The main results presented in this thesis are based on models formed from the BEAVRS benchmark. This chapter introduces the BEAVRS benchmark in Section~\ref{sec:beavrs-intro}, including a description of alteration made to the benchmark. Section~\ref{sec:beavrs-xs-gen} describes how cross-sections are generated for the benchmark. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:beavrs-models} details the particular models formed from cutouts of the BEAVRS model and, in some cases, replication of the cutouts.

In this thesis, the same 70 group cross-section library is used for all results involving the BEAVRS benchmark or cutouts of the BEAVRS benchmark. The

Note these all use modified heights, etc

\subsection{Full Core 3D Model}
\label{sec:beavrs-3D}

Talk about: really just the BEAVRS model directly

Important to note modifications

\subsection{Full Core 2D Model}
\label{sec:beavrs-2D}

Talk about: smaller model

Talk about: still incorporating radial detail including the radial water reflector (most importantly)

\subsection{Single Assembly Model}
\label{sec:beavrs-single-assembly}

Talk about: smaller model to do rigorous performance and MOC parameter opt analysis

\subsection{Truncated Single Assembly Model}
\label{sec:trunc-single-assembly}

Talk about: no reflector effects, similar to lattice calc

\subsection{SDSA Model}
\label{sec:sdsa}

The Single Domain Single Assembly Model (SDSA)

Talk about motivation: realistic on-node performance characterization

Talk about: no spacers

\subsection{Short Single Assembly Model}
\label{sec:short-single-assembly}

The Single Domain Single Assembly Model (SDSA)

Same as SDSA but shorter and 3.1\% enriched

Motivation: short runtime and flux peak in moderator for higher enriched bundles
Note that 3.1 is highest enriched in cycle 1 beavrs

\subsection{Replicated Assembly Lattice Model}
\label{sec:assembly-lattice}

Talk about motivation: weak scaling with even numbers
