\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:chap7-motivate}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item identify metrics of interest - eigenvalue, fission, capture rates
  \item match CE MC as closely as possible with deterministic MG theory
  \item understand spatial self-shielding effects in pin-wise MGXS
\end{itemize}
