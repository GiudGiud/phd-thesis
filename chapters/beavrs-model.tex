\label{app:beavrs}

The results presented in this thesis are based on models formed from the BEAVRS benchmark~\cite{horelik2013beavrs}. This appendix introduces the BEAVRS benchmark in Section~\ref{sec:beavrs-intro}, including a description of axial alterations made to the benchmark. Section~\ref{sec:beavrs-models} details the particular models formed from cutouts of the BEAVRS model.

\section{Introduction to the BEAVRS Benchmark}
\label{sec:beavrs-intro}

The BEAVRS benchmark~\cite{horelik2013beavrs} was released in 2013, representing a Westinghouse 4-loop nuclear power reactor. This reactor is representative of common \ac{PWR} designs in the United States. The benchmark contains core loadings and detector measurements for the first two cycles of operation, but this thesis concentrates on \ac{HZP} simulations at the beginning of the first cycle in an all rods out configuration.

The reactor contains 193 fuel assemblies. Each assembly contains a $17 \times 17$ lattice of fuel rods, guide tubes, and instrument tubes. The pin-pitch is 1.26 cm inside each assembly. All fuel rods within the same assembly contain uranium of the same enrichment. In the first cycle, three uranium enrichments are used: 1.6\%, 2.4\%, and 3.1\%. Wet annular burnable absorbers are present throughout the core to flatten the power distribution. The active fuel height is 365.76 cm. A radial description of the core is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beavrs-assembly-enrichment}.

One of the goals of this thesis is to simulate the BEAVRS benchmark using the explicit detail provided in the BEAVRS specification. However, in order to conduct uniform axial mesh refinement studies, the axial heights of material regions are altered such that each material discontinuity occurs at an even number of cm. The top and bottom grid spacers in the BEAVRS benchmark are 3.36 cm with intermediate grid spacers 5.72 cm. These lengths were altered to 2.0 cm and 6.0 cm, respectively. The starting height of the grid spacers were rounded to the nearest even integer. All other $z$-heights in the geometry were similarly rounded to the nearest even integer. The altering of axial heights allows regions to be formed which all have the same axial height, which simplifies axial uniform mesh refinement sensitivity studies. The altered axial heights are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:fuel-rod-spec}. While these alterations do change the benchmark slightly, and therefore also change the computed solutions, these solutions are still very close to those of the true BEAVRS benchmark.

Although the BEAVRS model is defined inside a cylindrical geometry, a rectangular bounding geometry is often used in \ac{MOC} methods for cyclic tracking. Therefore, the BEAVRS model is modeled with a rectangular prism bounding the geometry. In the radial plane, the bounding dimensions are square with sides equal to 17 assembly widths. Since the BEAVRS model has a maximum of 15 assemblies along each $x$ and $y$ direction, this allows at least one assembly of radial reflector to be modeled outside the core. In addition, the corners have very deep water reflectors. In the axial direction, the BEAVRS benchmark is modeled over a height of 400 cm, from 20 cm to 420 cm in the model specification, allowing approximately 20 cm of axial reflector in each direction. Vacuum boundaries are assumed on all surfaces. 

Cross-sections are generated for each unique material in the BEAVRS model. The cross-section generation procedures are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:cross-section-gen}. A plot of the BEAVRS benchmark colored by unique material region is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beavrs-materials-radial}. In addition, an axial plot of the materials is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beavrs-materials-axial}. Similarly the radial and axial material plots of a 1.6\% enriched fuel assembly are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beavrs-single-assembly-materials-radial} and Figure~\ref{fig:beavrs-single-assembly-materials-axial}, respectively.

\section{Description of BEAVRS Models}
\label{sec:beavrs-models}

All models which are simulated in this thesis are derived from cutouts of the BEAVRS benchmark with 70 group cross-sections, as described in Appendix~\ref{app:cross-section-gen}. Cutouts are formed in order to evaluate smaller problems which are representative of computational performance or physical behavior of the large full core problem.

\subsection{Full Core 3D Model}
\label{app:beavrs-3D}

The first model is the full core 3D BEAVRS model, incorporating all the details discussed in previous sections. The simulation of this model directly corresponds with the OpenMC simulations from which the cross-sections are derived.


\subsection{Full Core 2D Model}
\label{app:beavrs-2D}

A 2D extruded cutout of the reactor is formed in order to determine the physical behavior of the BEAVRS model in the radial direction. This cutout is taken from a 10 cm axial interval over which there are no grid spacers. Reflective boundary conditions are placed on the top and bottom of the problem. While this model lacks any axial variation, it still contains all radial detail except grid spacers. Due to the lack of axial detail, 2D \ac{MOC} and 3D \ac{MOC} simulations with sufficient parameter refinement should produce equivalent solutions. Only this model and the full core 3D model contain the full radial water reflector. Therefore, this model is very useful in determining the effect of large radial water reflectors. 

\subsection{Single Assembly Model}
\label{app:beavrs-single-assembly}

A single assembly model is formed which represents the full axial detail of a single 1.6\% enriched fuel assembly. While this model lacks radial water reflectors, it contains the full axial detail of the full core problem, including grid spacers. Outside the core, full geometrical detail is also captured including support plate / nozzles and, most notably, water reflectors of approximately 20 cm above and below the fuel. Reflective boundaries are placed on the $x$ and $y$ boundaries. Physically, this is equivalent to an infinite 2D lattice of 1.6\% enriched fuel assemblies. Vacuum boundaries remain on the top and bottom of this model. 

\subsection{Single Assembly Model without Reflectors}
\label{app:trunc-single-assembly}

In addition to the single assembly model, a single assembly model without reflectors is also formed which contains all the detail of the single assembly model, but without the axial water reflectors. Specifically, 20 cm are removed from both the bottom and top of the model, resulting in a model that only covers the active fuel and is 360 cm tall. Axial boundaries conditions are vacuum.

\subsection{SDSA Model}
\label{app:sdsa}

The Single Domain Single Assembly (SDSA) model represents a 20 cm tall cutout within the single assembly model which contains no grid spacers. Reflective boundary conditions are imposed on all surfaces.

\subsection{Short Single Assembly Model}
\label{app:short-single-assembly}

Similar to the SDSA model, the short single assembly model is created which allows for more feasible testing due to its far reduced size. This model is the same as the SDSA model except it is only 10 cm in axial height and contains 3.1\% enriched fuel. This enrichment is the highest enrichment found in the cycle 1 BEAVRS model. The greater fuel enrichment allows for slightly larger gradients with a flux peak in the moderator.


\subsection{Rodded Single Assembly Model}
\label{app:rodded-single-assembly}

The rodded single assembly model is the only model which uses a geometry not explicitly found in the full core 3D BEAVRS model. The model is constructed in the same way as the single assembly model described in Section~\ref{app:beavrs-single-assembly}, but with 3.1\% enriched fuel and with all rods inserted, covering approximately half of the active fuel height. The axial zones of guide tubes containing the inserted control rods are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:control-rod-spec}.

\input{figures/control-rod-insertion.tex}

The large control rod insertion causes significant gradients within the axial scalar flux distribution, allowing for robust testing of 3D \ac{MOC} on problems with significant axial variation. As mentioned previously, this model uses a separate cross-section library. Instead of simulating the all rods out configuration, which lacks control rods within the core, the rodded single assembly model is explicitly simulated in OpenMC to form cross-section estimates. This allows reasonable estimates of control rod material cross-sections.
